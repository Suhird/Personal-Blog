const n=`## Introduction to Go: Building CLI Tools

Go (Golang) has become a popular language for building command-line tools due to its simplicity, performance, and ability to compile to a single binary.

### Why Go for CLI Tools?

- **Single binary output** - no runtime dependencies
- **Cross-compilation** - build for any platform from any platform
- **Fast execution** - near-native performance
- **Concurrency** - built-in goroutines and channels
- **Rich standard library** - minimal external dependencies

### Basic CLI Structure

Here's a simple example of a CLI tool in Go:

\`\`\`go
package main

import (
"flag"
"fmt"
"os"
)

func main() {
// Define flags
name := flag.String("name", "World", "Who to greet")
flag.Parse()

    // Use flags in your program
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\\\\n", *name)

    os.Exit(0)

}
\`\`\`

### Using the Cobra Library

For more complex CLI tools, the Cobra library is highly recommended:

\`\`\`go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"github.com/spf13/cobra"
"os"
)

func main() {
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
Use: "myapp",
Short: "A brief description of your application",
Run: func(cmd \\*cobra.Command, args []string) {
fmt.Println("Hello from Cobra!")
},
}

    if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
    	fmt.Println(err)
    	os.Exit(1)
    }

}
\`\`\`

### Adding Subcommands

CLI tools often have subcommands like \\\`git commit\\\` or \\\`docker run\\\`:

\`\`\`go
var versionCmd = &cobra.Command{
Use: "version",
Short: "Print the version number",
Run: func(cmd \\*cobra.Command, args []string) {
fmt.Println("MyApp v0.1")
},
}

func init() {
rootCmd.AddCommand(versionCmd)
}
\`\`\`

### User Experience Best Practices

- Provide helpful error messages
- Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
- Add color to your output (github.com/fatih/color)
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Include comprehensive help text

### Distribution

One of Go's advantages is the ability to easily distribute your CLI tool:

\`\`\`bash

# Build for different platforms

GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-linux
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-macos
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp.exe
\`\`\`

### Conclusion

Go is an excellent choice for building CLI tools. With its performance, simplicity, and cross-platform capabilities, you can create powerful command-line applications that are easy to distribute and maintain.
